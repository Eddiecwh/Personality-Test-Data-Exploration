USdata <- filter(data, country == 'US')
USage <- filter(USdata, age < 100)
```
<p>We decided to focus soley on the US demographic of the data
   
   Then we decided to breakdown that data further and create
   histograms to seperate the data by: 
   
   - Gender
   - Race
   - Age</p>
   
<div class="headers">1 Dimensional Data Exploration</div>
   
<div class="titles">Gender</div>
   
```{R}
ggplot(data = USdata) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = gender)) + scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0,1,2,3),
    label = c("Missed", "Men", "Women", "Other")) +
    labs(title = "Bar Chart",
         subtitle = "Gender Distribution of BIG5 Test Takers (US)",
         caption="Source: https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/")
```

<p>This graph shows the different genders the personality test takers identified themselves as. Genders included men, women and other. This information is important because it demonstrates how diverse the measure of the Big-Five personality traits turned out based on the gender of the participants.</p>

<div class="titles">Age</div>

```{R}
ggplot(data = USage) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
    labs(title = "Bar Chart",
         subtitle = "Age Distribution of BIG5 Test Takers (US)",
         caption="Source: https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/")
```

<p>This graph tells us how old the personality test takers of the Big-Five personality traits are in comparison to the total amount of the participants. Immediately, we notice the majority of personality test takers fall between the ages of 13 and 25. The result of having a lot of young people who took this personality test could be because between the ages of 13 and 25, young adults are in need and applying for jobs. For instance, many undergraduate students start applying for internships and full-time positions. </p>

```{R}
ageBreaks <- c(13, 18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)

setDT(USage)[ , agegroups := cut (age,
                                  breaks = ageBreaks,
                                  right = FALSE,
                                  labels = ageLabels)]

              "West African, Bushmen, Ethiopian",
              "Other")

```
<p>The race in which the personality test takers identified themselves as is shown by this graph. The top three race categories that stand out include Caucasian (European), Other and Mixed Race. A reason why the categories "Other" and "Mixed Race" have a high count could be because ethnicities such as Hispanic is not considered a race under the Census Bureau. Federal policy defines "Hispanic" not as a race, but as an ethnicity. This type of case also applies to other ethnicities in the United States.</p>
